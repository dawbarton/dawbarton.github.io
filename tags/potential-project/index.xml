It is intended to be a starting point for discussion/further investigation rather than a complete research plan. If you are interested in working with me, see opportunities for new researchers.
Keywords: aeroelastics, scientific machine learning, control-based continuation, nonlinear dynamics
There is a drive towards high-efficiency and high-performance aircraft. This requires lighter and more fuel-efficient structural designs, which are often more flexible than traditional rigid designs.</description></item><item><title>Research project: Online learning for tactile robotics</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-online-learning-for-tactile-robotics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-online-learning-for-tactile-robotics/</guid><description>This is a potential research project for new research students.

Keywords: online learning, machine learning, tactile robotics, generative models
Machine learning (ML) equips robots with the ability to learn from and adapt to new environments, enhancing autonomy and efficiency in complex tasks.</description></item><item><title>Research project: Surrogate modelling and machine learning for electrical power systems</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-surrogate-modelling-electrical/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-surrogate-modelling-electrical/</guid><description>This is a potential research project for new research students. It is intended to be a starting point for discussion/further investigation rather than a complete research plan. If you are interested in working with me, see opportunities for new researchers.
Keywords: surrogate modelling, machine learning, reservoir computing, power electronics
Designing new devices, particularly in electrical power conversion for renewable energy, is often challenging because of constraints on mass, volume, and cost.</description></item><item><title>Broad areas for potential projects</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2021/broad-project-areas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2021/broad-project-areas/</guid><description>Here are some (very!) broad areas for possible PhD projects. I haven&amp;#39;t fleshed out any of the details but these are all areas that I&amp;#39;m interested in. Contact me if you&amp;#39;d like to pursue one of them.</description></item></channel></rss>
