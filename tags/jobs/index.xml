Itâ€™s a one year position that must finish at some point before end June 2023 (end of grant, now extended beyond the date given in the advert). In short Iâ€™m looking for someone with experience in (nonlinear) differential equations, ideally engineering background and some interest in uncertainty quantification. (And who programs in Julia, obviously ðŸ˜€)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The group is small but supportive and work at the interface between (engineering-focused) physical experiments and mathematical methods. We&amp;rsquo;re part of a wider applied mathematics/engineering dynamics research group that covers a wide range of interests.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
