I'm currently migrating this site to be a static site built with Franklin.jl &mdash; there might be a few issues to be resolved! (E.g., the blog...)

I’m a Reader (equivalent to Associate Professor for those outside the UK) in [Engineering Mathematics](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering-mathematics/) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), UK. I’m active in [research](/research) in nonlinear dynamics and control, mixed in with a bit of machine learning and robotics. I’m also husband to Johanna and father of Phoebe, Niamh, Esther, Titus, and Charlotte. These site is a mixture of my personal interests and my professional work ― who said business and pleasure don’t mix?!

I also have a [blog](/blog) but it isn't updated all that frequently.

You can find me on GitHub as [@dawbarton](https://github.com/dawbarton/) and Twitter as [@davidawbarton](https://twitter.com/DavidAWBarton) (though I don't use Twitter so much). If you are a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) user, you can usually find me on [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/) or [Slack](https://julialang.slack.com/) as @dawbarton.
