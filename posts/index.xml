Itâ€™s a one year position that must finish at some point before end June 2023 (end of grant, now extended beyond the date given in the advert). In short Iâ€™m looking for someone with experience in (nonlinear) differential equations, ideally engineering background and some interest in uncertainty quantification. (And who programs in Julia, obviously ðŸ˜€)
The group is small but supportive and work at the interface between (engineering-focused) physical experiments and mathematical methods.</description></item><item><title>Stability of delay differential equations (DDEs) in Julia</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2021/stability-of-delay-differential-equations-in-julia/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2021/stability-of-delay-differential-equations-in-julia/</guid><description>Another in my series of &amp;#39;try not to implement it yet again&amp;#39;, this time on how to calculate the stability of (linearised) delay differential equations.</description></item><item><title>Broad areas for potential projects</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2021/broad-project-areas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2021/broad-project-areas/</guid><description>Here are some (very!) broad areas for possible PhD projects.

Here I demonstrate the method using both Julia and MATLAB with Fourier collocation.</description></item><item><title>Working with broadcasting in Julia</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2019/working-with-broadcasting-in-julia/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2019/working-with-broadcasting-in-julia/</guid><description>Broadcasting in Julia is a way of writing vectorised code (think Matlab) that is performant and explicit. The benefits of performant code are obvious (faster!) but explicit vectorisation is also a significant benefit.
When I first saw Matlab and how you could call the sin with a vector input, I was (slightly) blown away by the usefulness of this. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take too long for me to realise the limitations though; vectorising a complicated function can require quite a bit of code gymnastics, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t usually help the readability, particularly for those students who are relatively new to programming.</description></item><item><title>BarycentricInterpolation.jl</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2018/barycentricinterpolation.jl/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2018/barycentricinterpolation.jl/</guid><description>Over the past couple of years or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting into the Julia programming language; it&amp;rsquo;s been great to watch the language mature over time. Many people proclaim the virtues of its speed (it&amp;rsquo;s very fast for a dynamic language) but really I like its elegance - it&amp;rsquo;s a very well designed language that makes full use of multiple dispatch. (Multiple dispatch is something that I doubt most coders know much about but once you are used to it, it&amp;rsquo;s indispensable!</description></item></channel></rss>
