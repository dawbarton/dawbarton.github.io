This is a potential research project for new research students. It is intended to be a starting point for discussion/further investigation rather than a complete research plan. If you are interested in working with me, see opportunities for new researchers.

Keywords: surrogate modelling, machine learning, reservoir computing, power electronics
Designing new devices, particularly in electrical power conversion for renewable energy, is often challenging because of constraints on mass, volume, and cost. Designers must innovate within these boundaries, making trade-offs to meet specifications without compromising performance. This PhD project will employ surrogate modelling and machine learning to improve the efficiency of design processes."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-surrogate-modelling-electrical/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.d6fcd20a4fb86efa4dfac8ec95da60244cc8871042183da1ef28e3a762ad79c8.css integrity="sha256-1vzSCk+4bvpN+sjsldpgJEzIhxBCGD2h7yjjp2Ktecg=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://cityinthesky.co.uk/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://cityinthesky.co.uk/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://cityinthesky.co.uk/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://cityinthesky.co.uk/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://cityinthesky.co.uk/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-surrogate-modelling-electrical/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-surrogate-modelling-electrical/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="David A W Barton"><meta property="og:title" content="Research project: Surrogate modelling and machine learning for electrical power systems"><meta property="og:description" content=" This is a potential research project for new research students.
