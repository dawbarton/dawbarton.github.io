Machine learning (ML) equips robots with the ability to learn from and adapt to new environments, enhancing autonomy and efficiency in complex tasks. However, many ML approaches rely on extensive data for training. This heavy reliance on large volumes of data can hamstring a robot&rsquo;s ability to function in dynamic real-world conditions—imagine a robotic assistant in a home struggling to recognize new types of objects because it was trained on a limited set of household items. Such data dependency limits the robots&rsquo; effectiveness in diverse real-world applications. We seek to overcome this problem in the context of tactile robotics by exploiting generative online learning, enabling robots to learn &lsquo;in the moment&rsquo; and adapt swiftly to the unpredictability of real-world tasks."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-online-learning-for-tactile-robotics/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.45e028aa8ce0961349adf411b013ee39406be2c0bc80d4ea3fc04555f7f4611a.css integrity="sha256-ReAoqozglhNJrfQRsBPuOUBr4sC8gNTqP8BFVff0YRo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://cityinthesky.co.uk/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://cityinthesky.co.uk/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://cityinthesky.co.uk/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://cityinthesky.co.uk/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://cityinthesky.co.uk/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-online-learning-for-tactile-robotics/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-online-learning-for-tactile-robotics/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="David A W Barton"><meta property="og:title" content="Research project: Online learning for tactile robotics"><meta property="og:description" content=" This is a potential research project for new research students.
