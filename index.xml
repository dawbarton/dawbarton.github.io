I have a broad range of research interests across the field of applied mathematics and (physics-based) machine learning, but I focus particularly on engineering-related applications including robotics. Many mathematicians would call me an engineer, whilst many would engineers call me a mathematician â€” you can form your own opinions ðŸ˜€.
Iâ€™m more generally interested in the theory/practice underpinning scientific computing and programming.</description></item><item><title>Opportunities for new researchers</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/research/new-researchers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/research/new-researchers/</guid><description>I manage a collaborative and friendly group of researchers who strive to do excellent work at the intersection of applied mathematics, engineering, and machine learning. We work within the larger Engineering Mathematics Research Group and have strong connections to other areas such as the Robotics Research Group, the Dynamics and Control Research Group, and the Computational Neuroscience Research Group. It&amp;rsquo;s a very supportive environment, with researchers going on to a wide range of opportunities including lectureships (e.</description></item><item><title>Current researchers</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/research/current-researchers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/research/current-researchers/</guid><description>If you are interested in working with me, either as a PhD student or a Research Associate (post-doctoral) take a look at my page on opportunities for new researchers.

Editorial note: I&amp;rsquo;ve often intended to create blog posts of papers that I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with but I&amp;rsquo;ve never managed to make time to do it.

There is a drive towards high-efficiency and high-performance aircraft. This requires lighter and more fuel-efficient structural designs, which are often more flexible than traditional rigid designs.</description></item><item><title>Research project: Online learning for tactile robotics</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-online-learning-for-tactile-robotics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-online-learning-for-tactile-robotics/</guid><description>This is a potential research project for new research students.

Designing new devices, particularly in electrical power conversion for renewable energy, is often challenging because of constraints on mass, volume, and cost.</description></item><item><title>12 month postdoc opportunity in (nonlinear) differential equations</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2022/digitwins-postdoc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2022/digitwins-postdoc/</guid><description>Iâ€™ve got a postdoctoral position open at the University of Bristol, UK: https://www.bristol.ac.uk/jobs/find/details/?jobId=264809.

The benefits of performant code are obvious (faster!) but explicit vectorisation is also a significant benefit.
When I first saw Matlab and how you could call the sin with a vector input, I was (slightly) blown away by the usefulness of this. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take too long for me to realise the limitations though; vectorising a complicated function can require quite a bit of code gymnastics, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t usually help the readability, particularly for those students who are relatively new to programming.</description></item><item><title>BarycentricInterpolation.jl</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2018/barycentricinterpolation.jl/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2018/barycentricinterpolation.jl/</guid><description>Over the past couple of years or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting into the Julia programming language; it&amp;rsquo;s been great to watch the language mature over time. Many people proclaim the virtues of its speed (it&amp;rsquo;s very fast for a dynamic language) but really I like its elegance - it&amp;rsquo;s a very well designed language that makes full use of multiple dispatch. (Multiple dispatch is something that I doubt most coders know much about but once you are used to it, it&amp;rsquo;s indispensable!</description></item><item><title/><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-active-learning-for-nonlinear-nodes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-active-learning-for-nonlinear-nodes/</guid><description>Active learning for neural ODEs with CBC</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/about-me/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/about-me/</guid><description>Iâ€™m a Professor of Computational and Experimental Mathematics in the School of Engineering Mathematics and Technology at the University of Bristol, UK.
