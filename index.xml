I also have a broad range of research interests across the field of applied mathematics and computer science. I focus particularly on engineering-related applications (e.g., aeroelastic flutter) and I have a sideline in tactile robotics (joint with &lt;a href="https://lepora.com/">Nathan Lepora&lt;/a>).

&lt;p>There is a drive towards high-efficiency and high-performance aircraft. This requires lighter and more fuel-efficient structural designs, which are often more flexible than traditional rigid designs. This flexibility can result in disastrous nonlinear behaviour; for example, the destruction of the NASA Helios prototype. This project seeks to develop new approaches to nonlinear behaviour in aircraft and so enable a new generation of low-carbon aircraft.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Research project: Online learning for tactile robotics</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-online-learning-for-tactile-robotics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-online-learning-for-tactile-robotics/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Keywords:&lt;/em> online learning, machine learning, tactile robotics, generative models&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Machine learning (ML) equips robots with the ability to learn from and adapt to new environments, enhancing autonomy and efficiency in complex tasks. However, many ML approaches rely on extensive data for training. This heavy reliance on large volumes of data can hamstring a robot&amp;rsquo;s ability to function in dynamic real-world conditionsâ€”imagine a robotic assistant in a home struggling to recognize new types of objects because it was trained on a limited set of household items. Such data dependency limits the robots&amp;rsquo; effectiveness in diverse real-world applications. We seek to overcome this problem in the context of tactile robotics by exploiting generative online learning, enabling robots to learn &amp;lsquo;in the moment&amp;rsquo; and adapt swiftly to the unpredictability of real-world tasks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Research project: Surrogate modelling and machine learning for electrical power systems</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-surrogate-modelling-electrical/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2023/project-surrogate-modelling-electrical/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Keywords:&lt;/em> surrogate modelling, machine learning, reservoir computing, power electronics&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Designing new devices, particularly in electrical power conversion for renewable energy, is often challenging because of constraints on mass, volume, and cost. Designers must innovate within these boundaries, making trade-offs to meet specifications without compromising performance. This PhD project will employ surrogate modelling and machine learning to improve the efficiency of design processes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>12 month postdoc opportunity in (nonlinear) differential equations</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2022/digitwins-postdoc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2022/digitwins-postdoc/</guid><description>&lt;p>Iâ€™ve got a postdoctoral position open at the University of Bristol, UK: &lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/jobs/find/details/?jobId=264809">https://www.bristol.ac.uk/jobs/find/details/?jobId=264809&lt;/a>.

The benefits of performant code are obvious (faster!) but explicit vectorisation is also a significant benefit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I first saw Matlab and how you could call the &lt;code>sin&lt;/code> with a vector input, I was (slightly) blown away by the usefulness of this. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take too long for me to realise the limitations though; vectorising a complicated function can require quite a bit of code gymnastics, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t usually help the readability, particularly for those students who are relatively new to programming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BarycentricInterpolation.jl</title><link>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2018/barycentricinterpolation.jl/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cityinthesky.co.uk/posts/2018/barycentricinterpolation.jl/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past couple of years or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting into the Julia programming language; it&amp;rsquo;s been great to watch the language mature over time.
