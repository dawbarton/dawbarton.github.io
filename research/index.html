I also have a broad range of research interests across the field of applied mathematics and computer science. I focus particularly on engineering-related applications (e.g., aeroelastic flutter) and I have a sideline in tactile robotics (joint with Nathan Lepora). Many mathematicians call me an engineer, whilst many engineers call me a mathematician â€” you can form your own opinions ðŸ˜€.

I manage a collaborative and friendly group of researchers who strive to do excellent work at the intersection of applied mathematics, engineering, and machine learning. We work within the larger Engineering Mathematics Research Group and have strong connections to other areas such as the Robotics Research Group, the Dynamics and Control Research Group, and the Computational Neuroscience Research Group. Itâ€™s a very supportive environment, with researchers going on to a wide range of opportunities including lectureships (e.g., Imperial, Exeter, Glasgow) and industrial careers (e.g., Dyson, Rolls Royce, GraphCore).

Whether hosting visiting PhD students or Professors, or remote work on a topic of mutual interest, Iâ€™m keen to explore new collaborations.
My research interests are quite varied and so there are many opportunities for collaboration. As such, if you are interested in collaborating with me, send me an email and we can discuss the possibilities.
