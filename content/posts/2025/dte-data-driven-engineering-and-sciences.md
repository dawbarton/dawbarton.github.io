For anyone who is interested in data-driven approaches to engineering problems (or more general science), I've been appointed the co-director of a new PhD programme in *Data-Driven Engineering and Sciences* in the [School of Engineering Mathematics and Technology](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/science-engineering/schools/eng-maths-tech/#research) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk).

If you are interested in a **fully-funded PhD** in one of the research areas covered by the school, see our [programme website](https://engmaths.github.io/ddes-dte/) for the application procedure. The deadline for applications is *26 February 2025.*

(As a disclaimer, I'm *not* going to be the primary supervisor of any of the new students to avoid conflicts of interest. There are many other great academics in the school to supervise you!)
