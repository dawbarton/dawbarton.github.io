title: "12 month postdoc opportunity in (nonlinear) differential equations"

Iâ€™ve got a postdoctoral position open at the University of Bristol, UK: https://www.bristol.ac.uk/jobs/find/details/?jobId=264809. Itâ€™s a one year position that must finish at some point before end June 2023 (end of grant, now extended beyond the date given in the advert). In short Iâ€™m looking for someone with experience in (nonlinear) differential equations, ideally engineering background and some interest in uncertainty quantification. (And who programs in Julia, obviously ðŸ˜€)

The group is small but supportive and work at the interface between (engineering-focused) physical experiments and mathematical methods. We're part of a wider applied mathematics/engineering dynamics research group that covers a wide range of interests.

For more information, get in touch with me at <david.barton@bristol.ac.uk>. Closing date for applications is 6 February 2022.
