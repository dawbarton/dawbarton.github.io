If you are interested in working with me, either as a PhD student or a Research Associate (post-doctoral) take a look at my page on [opportunities for new researchers](../new-researchers/).

## Current doctoral research students

* Jun Wang &mdash; working on control-based continuation for experimentally investigating the nonlinear dynamics of a Hawk aircraft model (started September 2024, co-supervised with Mark Lowenberg).
