Collaborative work is one of the best parts of academic life and my previous collaborations have led to many different contributions and outcomes. Whether hosting visiting PhD students or Professors, or remote work on a topic of mutual interest, I'm keen to explore new collaborations.

My [research interests](../background/) are quite varied and so there are many opportunities for collaboration. As such, if you are interested in collaborating with me, send me an email and we can discuss the possibilities.

Potential opportunities include

- Hosting visiting research students and academics on sabbaticals here in Bristol
- Reciprocal research visits
- Sharing of ideas/expertise/data/resources to simulate new research projects (including grant proposals)
- Workshop and conference organisation
- Developing student exchange programmes
- Industry partnerships and higher TRL development

In all my collaborations, I seek to follow the [UKRIO Code of Practice for Research](../ukrio-code-of-practice/) and I strongly encourage others to do the same.
