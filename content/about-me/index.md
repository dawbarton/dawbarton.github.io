I’m a Professor of Computational and Experimental Mathematics in the [School of Engineering Mathematics and Technology](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/schools/eng-maths-tech/) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), UK. I’m active in [research](/research/) in nonlinear dynamics and control mixed with scientific machine learning, and a bit of robotics. I'm always interested in new collaborations, so take a look at my [research](/research/) pages and get in touch.

I’m also husband to Johanna and father of Phoebe, Niamh, Esther, Titus, and Charlotte, and spend a lot of time involved in my local church [Emmanuel Bishopston](https://emmanuelbristol.org.uk/bishopston/).

I've been heavily involved with [open source](/open-source/) development in the past — you can find me on GitHub as [@dawbarton](https://github.com/dawbarton/). Since 2016, I've been an active [Julia](https://julialang.org/) user (and occasional contributor); you can usually find me on [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/) or [Slack](https://julialang.slack.com/) as @dawbarton.
