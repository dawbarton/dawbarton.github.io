title: "RTC"
---

A real-time controller designed around the BeagleBone Black. This low-cost piece of hardware (and associated software) can do the job of much more expensive commercial real-time control offerings (e.g., dSpace), though without a nice GUI interface. Matlab and Python interfaces available.

See the [GitHub page](https://github.com/dawbarton/rtc/) for the code. If you are interested in the RTC, it's best to get in touch with me as it's not that straightforward.
