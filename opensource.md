# Open source software

Here are some of the open source projects that I’ve worked on in the past. Sadly due to time constraints (and the fact that I don’t use the related platforms any more) both DCPcrypt and confluence-mathjax have been retired.

You can find many of my current code offerings on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/dawbarton).

If you want to contact me about any of these projects, you can email me at [davebarton@cityinthesky.co.uk](mailto:davebarton@cityinthesky.co.uk).

## RTC

A real-time controller designed around the BeagleBone Black. This low-cost piece of hardware (and associated software) can do the job of much more expensive commercial real-time control offerings (e.g., dSpace), though without a nice GUI interface. Matlab and Python interfaces available.

See the [GitHub page](https://github.com/dawbarton/rtc) for the code. If you are interested in the RTC, it's best to get in touch with me.

## PDF2SVG

A little program that converges a (page of a) PDF file into a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file which can be opened by Inkscape. It’s nothing more than a simple wrapper over the top of Poppler and Cairo.

Since it's quite popular, it gets [its own page](/opensource/pdf2svg/).

## BarycentricInterpolation.jl

A simple implementation of Barycentric polynomials (interpolation and differentiation) for generic numeric types using *Barycentric Lagrange Interpolation* by Berrut and Trefethen (SIAM Review 46, pgs. 501-517) in Julia.

Source code available from [BarycentricInterpolation.jl](https://github.com/dawbarton/BarycentricInterpolation.jl) on GitHub.
