# Academic Research 

For my publications, see my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=9lxSeYMAAAAJ&hl=en) as Google is better at updating lists than I am!

I have a broad range of research interests across the field of applied mathematics, but I focus particularly on engineering-related applications including robotics. Many mathematicians would call me an engineer, whilst many would engineers call me a mathematician &mdash; you can form your own opinions!

I’m more generally interested in the theory/practice underpinning scientific computing and programming. I'm very keen on the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and recommend it for technical computing.

My specialties include

* mathematical modelling (mostly engineering related, but I enjoy broader challenges and I’ve done some work in the bio-sciences), 
* the dynamics and control of nonlinear systems,
* numerical methods for dynamical systems (particularly in the area of bifurcation analysis),
* systems with delay (mostly delay differential equations).

Despite being focussed on mathematics, I'm keen to 'get my hands dirty' by working directly with physical experiments. As such, the challenges of dealing with systems that are stochastic or uncertain are of significant interest to me. As such, Scientific Machine Learning is an area that I am focussing on at the moment since it brings the possibility of fusing physics-based differential-equation models with machine learnt models. Chris Rackauckas has produced a nice tutorial for doing [SciML in Julia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwVO0Xh2Hbg).
